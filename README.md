# CodeNebula
A futuristic guide to C++ concepts from C++98 to C++26, with clear explanations, real-world scenarios, and code examples.

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive resource for learning C++ concepts, covering both core language features and the Standard Template Library (STL). Start with the [master document](./docs/cpp_concepts_master.md) for a complete list of concepts by standard. Detailed documentation with explanations, scenarios, and code examples will be added in standard-specific folders.
