# C++03 Core Language Concepts

This document covers new or evolved C++03 core language concepts, with simple explanations, real-world scenarios, and short code snippets. Full examples will be added in [examples folder](../examples/C++03/). Only additions from C++98 are included.

## Value Initialization (C++03 Addition)
**Explanation**: Initializes objects to zero or default values if no initializer is provided, improving consistency over C++98â€™s partial initialization.  
**Real-World Scenario**: Ensure all elements in a configuration struct are zero-initialized in a system settings manager.  
**Snippet**:  
```cpp
struct Config { int x; }; Config cfg = Config();
```
**Example**: [value_initialization.cpp](../examples/C++03/value_initialization.cpp)
